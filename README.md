## Dining Philosophers Problem

The **Dining Philosophers Problem** is a classic concurrency problem that helps to understand synchronization issues when multiple processes share limited resources. In this problem:

- A group of philosophers sit around a round table with a large bowl of spaghetti in the center.
- Philosophers alternate between three states: eating, thinking, and sleeping. A philosopher can only eat if they have acquired both the fork to their right and the fork to their left.
- The table has as many forks as philosophers, with each fork shared between neighboring philosophers. Philosophers cannot share information or communicate with one another.
- The challenge is to design a solution that allows all philosophers to eat without leading to deadlock (where no one can eat) or starvation (where a philosopher never gets to eat).

### Key Features
- Philosophers alternate between eating, thinking, and sleeping.
- To eat, a philosopher needs to pick up both their left and right forks.
- After eating, they return the forks to the table and go to sleep.
- Philosophers must avoid starvation, meaning each philosopher must get the chance to eat.
- The solution should prevent deadlock, where all philosophers could be waiting indefinitely for forks to become available.

### Goals
- Ensure that all philosophers eventually get a chance to eat.
- Prevent any philosopher from dying due to starvation.
- Implement a fair and deadlock-free solution to the resource-sharing problem.

This project provides a simulation of the Dining Philosophers Problem and demonstrates the use of synchronization techniques in concurrent programming.

The program simulates the Dining Philosophers Problem and requires the following command-line arguments to run:

```sh
./philosophers number_of_philosophers time_to_die time_to_eat time_to_sleep [number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]
```

Arguments:

    number_of_philosophers (int):
        The number of philosophers (and the same number of forks) in the simulation.

    time_to_die (int, in milliseconds):
        If a philosopher doesnâ€™t start eating within time_to_die milliseconds after their last meal or since the simulation began, the philosopher will die.

    time_to_eat (int, in milliseconds):
        The time it takes for a philosopher to eat. During this period, the philosopher must hold two forks (both the one on their left and right).

    time_to_sleep (int, in milliseconds):
        The time a philosopher spends sleeping after finishing their meal.

    number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat (optional, int):
        The number of times each philosopher must eat. If specified, the simulation stops when all philosophers have eaten at least this number of times. If not provided, the simulation continues until a philosopher dies.
